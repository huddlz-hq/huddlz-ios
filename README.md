# Huddlz iOS

Native iOS starter app built with Swift and SwiftUI. No third-party dependencies or backend connection yet.

## Requirements

- Xcode 26.6 (used to create this project)
- iOS 26.5 simulator runtime
- Current deployment target: iOS 26.5; iPhone and iPad supported by the template. Revisit the minimum OS before building product features.

## Run

1. Open `Huddlz/Huddlz.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select the `Huddlz` scheme and an iPhone simulator.
3. Press Command-R to build and run.
4. Press Command-U to run tests.

## Physical device setup

Add your Apple account in Xcode Settings, then select your development team under the app target's Signing & Capabilities tab. Automatic signing is enabled. Use the same team for test targets when testing on a physical device.

The initial bundle identifier is `com.huddlz.Huddlz`. Confirm the organization's identifier before registering the app for distribution.

## Layout

- `Huddlz/Huddlz/`: SwiftUI app entry point, starter view, and assets.
- `Huddlz/HuddlzTests/`: Swift Testing unit test target.
- `Huddlz/HuddlzUITests/`: XCTest UI and launch tests.

Keep new code grouped by feature as features are added. Add shared UI and networking code when needed. Store private server credentials on the backend, never in the app or repository.
